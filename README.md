# Kaleidoscope Kitchen
 
## Description
 
As a result of COVID-19, we are forced to cook and eat at home more. Many of us are tired of cooking, let alone eating the same boring food day in and day out. We created this website to inspire people to try new recipes and awake their palate to international flavors. We also wanted to help individuals or families who are facing hardships during this pandemic, by delivering meals to transitional housing.                                                                                                                                                                                                  
 
We coded our site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
We used One Page Wonder for the Bootstrap template: https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-one-page-wonder.git
